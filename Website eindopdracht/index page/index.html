        <p>
          Despite their scary reputation, sharks rarely ever attack humans and
          would much rather feed on fish and marine mammals. Only about a dozen
          of the more than 300 species of sharks have been involved in attacks
          on humans.

          Even when diving with more aggressive sharks like bull sharks and
          great white sharks, you will be entirely secure if you go with an
          experienced, knowledgeable dive team.

        <h4>shark diet</h4>
        <p>
          Sharks are opportunistic feeders, but most sharks primarily feed on
          smaller fish and invertebrates. Some of the larger shark species prey
          on seals, sea lions, and other marine mammals.

        <h4>sharks are important to the ecosystem</h4>
        <p>
          Sharks keep ocean ecosystems in balance Sharks limit the abundance of
          their prey, which then affects the prey of those animals, and so on
          throughout the food web. Because sharks directly or indirectly affect
          all levels of the food web, they help to maintain structure in healthy
          ocean ecosystems.
